# A template for embedded systems?

Nowadays cool kids just want to know what others are doing: "what's the resolution/crosshair/mouse model this pro player uses?". Actually it's also the case even for what type of food a particular group prefers. Paying more attention, you'd have to agree that the case in the computing world is **much** more serious. The paranoia starts wanting to know what kind of neural network company X uses for whatever and then people are already discussing what font you should use on your linux. It might seem, perhaps, harmless or childish or irrelevant but surely you know the meme: "btw, i use arch". And of course, you've already stumbled on someone preaching that "you should program in python", "actually, rust is just amazing for that", "one of the most promising languages nowadays is GO", "try erlang, I had good results", "nah, there's nothing better C/C++" and it literally never stops.

So what's the point anyways? I want to make this template my own template so I can keep working on and improving it until I feel comfortable. Well, even finding a good setup to sit on your chair is kind of hard and it takes time, experiencing and trying other things: there are many heights and position adjustments, materials, or even colors and designs. Still, you're not going to have the pleasure of comfortably sitting on your own chair wherever you go even after all that effort but knowing what works and what doesn't **for you** is what matters and that's the point here. Therefore, this is my way of doing it for embedded systems.
